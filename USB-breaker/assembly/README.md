1. The PCB with the edges already cut.
2. Yes, it fits perfectly in the casing.
3. Oops. Touched the trace while cutting the rectangular cutout.
4. The first parts populated on the PCB. The mini USB is a pain in the ass to solder by hand.
5. All parts populated. If you look closely, you'll see that I soldered the wrong resistor (R2).
6. Another oops: That won't work. Bummer!
7. The holes for the controls were drilled.
8. Both controls are mounted. The LED is still missing, though.
9. The right (input) side. It's really horrible to file the cutout for the mini USB connector.
10. The left (output) side. A standard type A connector is easy though.
11. That's the external interface.
12. The connected front panel. I should have used thinner wire. This is 0.22 mmÂ² wire.
